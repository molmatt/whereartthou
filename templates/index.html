      <p> Every day, 'Where Art Thou' pulls the last ten images from the twitter feeds of art museums in New York City. <br>
          It then runs these images through a convolutional neural network to filter out images that are not art. While<br>
          the filtering process is not perfect, it accomplishes the task with 89% accuracy. That being said, if you do see <br>
          anything you wouldn't classify as art, feel free to skip rating that image. It won't factor in to the suggestion. </p>

          <p> Have fun! </p>
